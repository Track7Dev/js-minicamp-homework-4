Callback Function: 
	-a Callback function is a function(block of code to do something) that is placed
	in the paramater of another function to be called and run inside of that function.
Closure:
	-Closure is when a function(block of code to do something) inside of another function
	that has access to data stored iside itself, the outer function, and the global data 
	outside of that function

arguments:
	-arguments are the data passed into the paramaters of a function.
	- the arguments Object is an array(Container) of arguments(Data) used when the 
	function(block of code to do something) was called;
	-The arguments Object is used when you want the function to take in an unkown amount of data
	
Recursion:
	-Recursion is when you use a Function(block of code to do something) to invoke or call itself.

prototype:
	-prototypes is the original Object(Noun) and each cloned Object inherits the properties(adj), data, 
	and methods(Block of code to do something)from that prototype;
Constructors:
	-A contructor is an Object that holds default template of properties that you populate when the
	constuctor is invoked(Called)
